US Voter Registration Trends: 2016 vs. 2020
Project Overview
This project analyzes trends in new voter registration across the United States, comparing patterns leading up to the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections. By examining registration data at both the national and state levels, this analysis provides insights into voter engagement and the potential impact of external factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, on the registration process.

Research Questions
How did voter registration patterns change in the months leading up to the 2016 and 2020 elections across different states?

How did the voter registration pattern of Washington D.C. specifically change from 2016 to 2020?

Data Source
The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from FiveThirtyEight, containing new voter registration counts by jurisdiction (state), year, and month.

Source URL: FiveThirtyEight Voter Registration Data

Technologies Used
Python 3

Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning.

Seaborn & Matplotlib: Data visualization and statistical plotting.

GeoPandas: Geospatial analysis and mapping.

Key Insights
Top Performing States: California, Texas, and Florida consistently showed the highest average and total new voter registrations. Texas exceeded the national average 8 times during the periods studied.

Temporal Trends: Registration typically peaks in February and March. However, 2020 saw a significant decline in registration numbers during March, April, and May compared to 2016, likely due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Washington D.C. Case Study: D.C. experienced a sharp contrast between election cycles. While 2016 showed a steady increase in registration from January to May, 2020 showed a consistent decrease over the same period.

Demographic Proportionality: Analysis confirms that new voter registration is generally proportional to state population size, with larger states dominating total counts.

Visualizations
The project includes:

Bar Plots: Comparing total registrations per state and monthly registration totals across 2016 and 2020.

Choropleth Map: A geospatial visualization of average new voter registration across the United States.

Future Work
Expanded Timeframe: Incorporate data from the 2008, 2012, and 2024 elections to establish a more robust baseline for "normal" registration trends outside of a pandemic year.

Partisan Analysis: Analyze party affiliation data to understand registration shifts between Democrats, Republicans, and Independents.

Demographic Depth: Integrate race and gender data to identify which populations may require more focused outreach and advertising.
